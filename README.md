Eresos is a fork of the [Harmony](https://github.com/ss14-harmony/ss14-harmony) fork of [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14). Differences from Harmony are for the most part pretty minimal.

Space Station 14 is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), a homegrown engine written in C#.
